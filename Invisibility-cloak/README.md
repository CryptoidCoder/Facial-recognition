if using this, you need to use the command ```pip install requirements.txt``` to pip install all the things you need.
then ```python Invisibility_Cloak.py```

this program will take a still image and then put the live stream in front of it so...

1) make sure your not in the still image, it will take about 1-2 seconds to take the background image.
2) make sure to use a red cloth, blanket etc
3) you may need to turn asome lights on as this doesnt differentiate very well in low lit areas.
